### Hello!

Iâ€™m an AI software engineer from Estonia, currently based in Munich.

**ðŸ’» My work**

I have written the [SIURU](https://github.com/fukuda-lab/siuru) framework to detect network anomalies with supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, extracted [insights](https://doi.org/10.1109/ITHET50392.2021.9759809) from large collections of student feedback to improve lectures, developed [map](https://github.com/ndsev/mapget) [data](https://github.com/ndsev/erdblick) [tools](https://github.com/Klebert-Engineering/zsomeip/) in Python and C++, taught a humanoid robot to [chat](https://github.com/Roboy/roboy_dialog), and much more.

**ðŸ”­ What Iâ€™m seeking**

I am all about developing AI solutions that help people lead a happier, smarter, and more sustainable lifestyle. Sounds exactly like what your team is working on, and you are looking for a developer to join the mission? [Then get in touch!](https://cal.com/l-laura/coffee-chat) Ideally, the open role would benefit from my experience with ML & data analysis frameworks, containerization, Python/C++/Java development, CI/CD, and scripting.
