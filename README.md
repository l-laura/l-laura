# Hello!

I'm an AI software engineer from Estonia, currently based in Munich.

## ðŸ’» My work
I have written the [SIURU](https://github.com/fukuda-lab/siuru) framework to detect network anomalies with supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, extracted [insights](https://doi.org/10.1109/ITHET50392.2021.9759809) from large collections of student feedback to improve lectures, developed [map](https://github.com/ndsev/mapget) [data](https://github.com/ndsev/erdblick) [tools](https://github.com/Klebert-Engineering/zsomeip/) in Python and C++, taught a humanoid robot to [chat](https://github.com/Roboy/roboy_dialog), and much more.

## ðŸ”­ Seeking
I'm passionate about AI solutions that help people lead happier, smarter, and more sustainable lifestyles. Sounds exactly like what your team is working on? Looking for a developer to join the mission, ideally with experience in ML & data analysis, containerization, Python/C++/Java development, CI/CD, and scripting?
