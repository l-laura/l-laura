### Hello ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a software engineer from Estonia currently based in Munich.

**My work ðŸ’»**

I have written the [SIURU](https://github.com/fukuda-lab/siuru) framework to detect network anomalies with supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, extracted [insights](https://doi.org/10.1109/ITHET50392.2021.9759809) from large collections of student feedback to improve lectures, developed [map](https://github.com/ndsev/mapget) [data](https://github.com/ndsev/erdblick) [tools](https://github.com/Klebert-Engineering/zsomeip/) in Python and C++, taught a humanoid robot to [chat](https://github.com/Roboy/roboy_dialog), and much more.

**What Iâ€™m seeking ðŸ”­**

I aspire to develop data analysis and machine learning solutions that help us lead smarter and more sustainable lifestyles. If you are seeking to fill an all-rounder position that makes use of my experience with full stack development, Docker, CI, scripting, and ML & data analysis frameworks, get in touch!
