### Hello ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a software engineer from Estonia currently based in Munich.

**My work ðŸ’»**

I have written a framework to detect network anomalies with supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, extracted insights from large collections of student feedback to improve lectures, developed map data visualization and editing tools in Python and C++, taught a humanoid robot to chat like a human, and much more.

**What Iâ€™m seeking ðŸ”­**

I cherish all opportunities to make innovative ideas become reality and collaborate with amazing people. I aspire to work on data analysis and machine learning for products that help us lead smarter and more sustainable lifestyles. My dream position would challenge me to continuously learn about cutting-edge natural language processing or generative AI applications, MLOps, and cloud services. If you are seeking to fill an all-rounder position that makes use of my experience with Docker, CI, agile development, Bash scripting, and Python libraries for ML/data analysis, contact me over LinkedIn!
